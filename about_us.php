                    1960-<br>
              EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) permits companies to carry out electronic transactions. 
              Although the concept of eCommerce did not touch the daily Internet user till the era of 1990s 
              yet some big players had started to use EDI as early as 1960.
              The railroad industry was among the first to understand the importance of EDI and 
              start using the same. Other players in the transportation industry followed.
              <br><br>1981-<br>
                It was the year 1981 when Thomson Holidays picked up 66 travel agents from around England 
                and connected them in order to come up with what has been tagged as first B2B (Business to Business) 
                online shopping.
                <br><br>1990<br>
              Here we go. The year which marked the launch of the first web browser. The name of the 
              browser was WorldWideWeb which was later renamed to Nexus so as to avoid the obvious confusion. 
              Nexus was also the editor for programmers who coded websites.
              <br><br>2000 and Onwards<br>
               As they say, what followed after Google is history. Be it the dot com bubble or the Web 2.0, the 
               Internet has experienced exponential growth (with its own pitfalls) that has shaped the lives of many.
                As we know it, the Internet continues to grow with major and minor eCommerce companies launching 
                their own set of stores. Today, we can literally buy anything via the Internet. That is the 
                wonderland of eCommerce. <br><br>
